# Fake News Detection

This repository contains the code and resources used for a project on detecting fake news using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## Overview

The Fake News Detection project is designed to:

- Preprocess and clean news data
- Train machine learning models to classify news as fake or real
- Evaluate and deploy the models for real-time fake news detection

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Flask**: Web framework for the API
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Numpy**: Numerical computations
- **Google Colab**: For running and testing notebooks

## Project Outline

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   **Objective:** Clean and preprocess the news data for training.  
   **Tools:** NLTK, Pandas, Numpy
   
2. **Feature Extraction**  
   **Objective:** Extract relevant features from the text data using TF-IDF vectorization.  
   **Tools:** Scikit-Learn
   
3. **Model Training**  
   **Objective:** Train machine learning models to classify news as fake or real.  
   **Tools:** Scikit-Learn
   
4. **Model Evaluation**  
   **Objective:** Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   **Tools:** Scikit-Learn
   
5. **Model Deployment**  
   **Objective:** Deploy the trained model using Flask for real-time fake news detection.  
   **Tools:** Flask

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
```

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Using the Application

Once the application is running, you can interact with the fake news detection system via the web interface. Input news headlines or articles and get predictions on whether they are fake or real.

### Endpoints

#### Detect Fake News

- **Endpoint:** `/predict`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Predict whether a given news article or headline is fake or real.
- **Request Body:**
  - `text`: The news article or headline to be analyzed.
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK`: Successful response with the prediction (fake or real).
  - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input format or processing error.

## Examples

Check the `/notebooks` directory for example notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation tasks.
